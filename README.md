# Welcome to the unofficial mpesa-api documentation

This is an attempt to re-create the official Safaricom's M-Pesa API which is currently written in PDF.

## Getting Started  
This documentation is created using mkdocs therefore in order run it locally you need to have python, pip and ofcourse mkdocs installed 

### To install `mkdocs` just run the following command
 `pip install mkdocs` 

Start the live-reloading docs server.

 `mkdocs serve` 

Now you can view the documentation by just going to 

`http://localhost:8000`
