# tigoPesa Api documentation

How the tigoPesa API documententation should look like

This is an attempt to re-write the official tigoPesa's API in a developer friendly way.
the current documentantion is written in pdf which makes it difficult to work on and hard to 
browse through the documentation. This is an attampt to make it easier for developers to work on this new & exciting 
API. [Read More About the tigoPesa API here](https://www.tigo.co.tz/tigo-pesa-for-developers)

A lot of effort was spent to make this as accurate as possible, However, If there is any error/confusion please refer to the original documents found [here](https://www.tigo.co.tz/tigo-pesa-for-developers)
